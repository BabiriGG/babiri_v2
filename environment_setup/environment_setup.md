# Environment Setup

# Python Setup

This guide assumes you have `pip` installed. If not, please follow the [PyPi Tutorial](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to install pip. Check if `pip` is installed by running `pip --version`.

If you already have a virtual environment set up (or have no need), feel free to run `setup.sh`.

## Virtual Environment

A virtual environment allows developers to isolate their installations.

### Creating a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment at the root of the project directory.

```
python3 -m venv $pwd/..
```

### Activating the Virtual Environment

Activate the newly created virtual environment.

```
source venv/bin/activate
```
